"""Request/response models for the Registry/Discovery Service.

These define the wire contract between agent processes (which register and
heartbeat) and consumers (which discover agents). The agent payload itself is
the shared :class:`AgentMeta` pydantic model so there is no schema drift between
what an agent advertises and what consumers deserialize.
